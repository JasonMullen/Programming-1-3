    Assignment:Instructions
    Write a Circle class that has the following member variables:
    *radius드 double
    *pi드 double initialized with the value 3.14159
    The class should have the following member functions:
    *Default Constructor드 default constructor that sets radius to 0.0
    *Constructor드ccepts the radius of the circle as an argument
    *setRadius드 mutator function for the radius variable
        getRadius드n accessor function for the radius variable
    *getAreareturns the area of the circle, which is calculated as
        area = pi * radius * radius
    *getDiameterreturns the diameter of the circle, which is calculated as
        diameter = radius * 2
    *getCircumferencereturns the circumference of the circle, which is calculated as
        circumference = 2 * pi * radius


    Write a Rectangle class that has the following member variables:
    *length드 double
    *width - a double
    The class should have the following member functions:
    *Default Constructor드 default constructor that sets length and width to 0.0
    *Constructor드ccepts the length of the rectangle as an argument
    *setLength드 mutator function for the length variable
    *getLength드n accessor function for the length variable
    *setWidth드 mutator function for the width variable
    *getWidth드n accessor function for the width variable
    *getAreareturns the area of the rectangle, which is calculated as
    *area = length * width
    *getPerimeterreturns the perimeter of the rectangle, which is calculated as
    *perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
        Write a program that demonstrates both the Circle and the Rectangle class.
        Ask the user for the circle뇹 radius, creating a Circle object, then reporting the circle뇹 area, diameter, and circumference. 
        Ask the user for the length and width of a rectangle and creating a Rectangle object, then reporting the rectangle's area, and perimeter.
