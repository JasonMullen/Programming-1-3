    Assignment:

    Car Class
Write a class named Car that has the following member variables:
    *yearModel—an int that holds the car’s year model
    *make—a string that holds the make of the car
    *speed—an int that holds the car’s current speed
    
In addition, the class should have the following constructor and other member functions:
    *Constructor—The constructor should accept the car’s year model and make as arguments.
    *These values should be assigned to the object’s yearModel and make member variables.
    *The constructor should also assign 0 to the speed member variables.
    
Accessor—appropriate accessor functions to get the values stored in an object’s yearModel, make, and speed member variables
    *accelerate—The accelerate function should add 5 to the speed member variable each time it is called.
    *brake—The brake function should subtract 5 from the speed member variable each time it is called.
    * 
Demonstrate the class in a program that creates a Car object, then calls the accelerate function five times.
    *After each call to the accelerate function, get the current speed of the car and display it. 
    *Then, call the brake function five times. After each call to the brake function, get the current speed of the car and display it.
