/*Program discription:
	1.)This program takes the sales rate and multiplies it by the sales percentage to get the sales amount.
	2.)Next, it takes the sales amount and adds it to the sales rate to get the total amount.
	3.)Then it finally displays the figures of each variable as well as the desired result.
